Software 2 Project - Java Application Development

The purpose of this application is to meet the business requirements stated by the software company I have
been contracted to. They want a working GUI scheduling application that meets their needs and performs well
in a business environment. It must be able to be read and maintained by other programmers.

This application was created by James Blankenship on April 4th, 2022. It's currently in it's first version
(Version 1.0), and the last update was on April 5th, 2022. Contact James via email at Jbla484@wgu.edu.
